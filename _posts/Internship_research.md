## Introduction
**Brief premise**: the following considerations derive mainly from my _personal experience_ and comparisons with a small group of friends and colleagues who found themselves in the same situation.
<br/>
As a student nearing the end of my university journey, I believe it's important to share some reflections on a crucial phase of the French academic experience (but not limited to): the internship search. <br/>
During the period from September 29, 2023, to February 28, 2024, I submitted a total of 161 internship applications (mostly in France). However, only 24 companies contacted me to proceed with the application (only 6 of them actually proposed me the job), while for the rest, I received only automatic rejection emails or, worse, ghosting. <br/>

After surpassing 50 applications, I felt ashamed to discuss it with my colleagues. However, after crossing the 100 mark, I realized that the situation was more common than I had thought. In fact, after various discussions, I discovered that in previous years, some people had surpassed 250 applications before finding an internship.

## One stage to rule them all
During these six months of searching, I wondered what could be the causes of this difficulty in finding an internship offer. To date, some points I have reflected on are as follows:
 - **Start date of the internship search**: I started searching for internships only at the end of September, unaware of the challenges I would encounter. I should have started the search one or two months earlier to access more opportunities and encounter less competition in the market.

 - **Internship topics**, it is undeniable that artificial intelligence is the topic of the moment, and all companies are pushing in that direction. However, the number of aspiring computer engineers (and others) specializing in this field is enormous and continuously increasing. In discussions with HR professionals at various job fairs, I found that the difference in the number of candidates for AI and non-AI offers (e.g., cybersecurity) is on the order of thousands.

 - **Limited knowledge of the French language**, although English is the most widely used language in the tech world, knowing the language of the country where you are seeking the internship can be a significant advantage over other candidates. In this competitive landscape, even the slightest advantage can be meaningful.

 - **Lack of professional experience**, this is because I spent my academic years solely focusing on passing exams, albeit achieving decent results. Additionally, the organization of exam sessions in Italy rarely allows for summer internships. The problem is that having good grades is not enough to stand out in the sea of candidates; paradoxically, having prior experiences before applying for an internship truly sets one apart from the rest of the candidates (like me).

Despite the challenges mentioned earlier, I've secured an upcoming opportunity. Stay hopeful and continue with your efforts, you will get it! <br/>
If you are still searching for an internship or have encountered difficulties in doing so, here are some lessons I have learned from this exhausting experience.

## Failure teaches success
**The outcome of an interview does not determine your worth**; it may seem like a clichÃ© (yes, I've received it multiple times in automatic rejection emails), but the sooner we understand it, the less demotivated we will be during this long journey.<br/>

After 4 months, I began to feel nauseous just by reading the previews of automatically generated emails. I started to doubt myself and feel emotionally drained. However, the real difference lies in considering a failed interview as an opportunity to seek further clarification on what went wrong from those who interviewed us and to learn as much as possible from the mistakes made.<br/>

Regarding this, my advice is simple: don't rush to apply for the most appealing offers. Counterintuitively, it's better to first test yourself by attending interviews for other offers. Once you've gained a certain level of confidence, then apply for the offers you consider the best.

## An intern is nÌ¶oÌ¶tÌ¶ judged by the cover
Nowadays, LinkedIn boasts approximately 830 million registered users worldwide, meaning that we represent only 0.00000012048% of the users. In this vast sea of profiles, the first challenge we must tackle is to surpass the initial candidate selection phase, using the only weapon at our disposal: the **CV**. <br/>

But the challenge doesn't end there. Modern society adds another layer of isolation. It might surprise you to know that, nowadays, your resume is unlikely to be evaluated by a human being but rather analyzed by an _ATS_ (Applicant Tracking Software), especially if it's a large company. Therefore, it becomes crucial to maximize the score of our CV. Some useful tips found around the web include: using LaTeX, adopting a single-column format, keeping the document to one page, and tailoring the CV as closely as possible to the job offer, using the same keywords.<br/>
A personal suggestion is to create different versions of your CV for different languages and send the one that matches the language used in the job offer. <br/>
Various online platforms allow you to analyze your CV on different ATS, providing an indicative score related to specific job offers.
## The importance of training...
After surviving the initial selection round, the Hunger Games continue with one (or more) technical interviews. It's crucial to study your CV thoroughly, ensuring you understand every detail and can discuss it confidently. Additionally, delve deep into the topics relevant to the job offer. While no one expects you to know everything about every topic, failing to answer a question could sometimes cost you the position (ðŸ™‚). Regularly practicing programming exercises, such as those on LeetCode, is essential to maintain problem-solving skills and reinforce technical knowledge.<br/>
One strategy I started late but found beneficial was keeping a record of questions asked in previous interviews.

## ...and of the organisation
Lastly, maintaining a structured and organized approach to the internship search process is key to maximizing efficiency and productivity. Keeping track of application deadlines, networking events, and follow-up tasks can prevent missed opportunities and ensure timely responses. Utilizing spreadsheets, calendars, or task management tools can help streamline the process and alleviate some of the stress associated with managing multiple applications simultaneously. Remember, consistency and perseverance are essential qualities in navigating the challenging journey of securing an internship.
